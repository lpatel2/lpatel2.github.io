# Project 1 Proposal

## Topic
This project will examine if and how pipeline development in Chester County, PA affects non-white neighborhoods and municipalies disproportionately to predominantly white neighborhoods. I could expand this to multiple counties or the entire state if this scope turns out to be too small/specific however, I chose this scale because of the high Hispanic migrant population in Chester County.

## Data
 I found Chester County demographic data from https://chescoplanning.org/Resources/Data.cfm and pipeline data at https://chesco.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTools/index.html?appid=873f036ecb6d418c9cf80eaa022c48b7

## Transformations/Subsets
 I need to determine which neighborhoods/municipalites are predominantly non-white from the census data.

## Analysis
I will be analyzing where both current and planned pipeline projects are placed and if they are disproportionately routed through municipalities with a higher minority population.

## Outputs
I will create a map showing proportions of non-white to white populations in each municipality that also includes pipeline routes through the county. This will relate to class because I will perform this analysis using QGIS and will use skills that we have practiced in the walkthroughs & labs thus far this semester.
