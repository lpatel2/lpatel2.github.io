# Project 3: Assessing Sustainability Levels in Philadelphia

[<img src="/images/project3.png?raw=true"/>](/projects/webmap/project3webmap/index.html)

This map shows the “most sustainable” areas of Philadelphia by zip code, with the most sustainable areas being shown in the darkest green and the least sustainable areas in white. The sustainability of each area was evaluated based on five metrics: bike share locations, energy efficient buildings (large buildings with an energy star rating of 75 or above), farmers markets, green stormwater infrastructure sites, and solar panel installations. I collected all of these datasets from OpenDataPhilly and joined them to the zip code shapefile, and calculated the count of each of these things within that zip code (when you click on the zip code area in the webmap, the last five numbers are the count of each of the five metrics, respectively). I then created a total count of all 5 things in each zip code and divided this by the population density of each zip code so these counts were relative to the amount of people living in the area and using these things, so an area with fewer bike shares and a lower population, for example, would not be considered less sustainable than an area that had more bike shares simply because there were more people living in the area who would be using them. I really wanted to get a dynamic bar chart up and running so that when you hovered over each zip code area, you could see how many of each thing was included in that area but I wasn’t able to get it to work.
