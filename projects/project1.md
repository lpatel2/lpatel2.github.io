<img src="/images/on_thin_ice.png?raw=true"/>
On Thin Ice is a spherical video presentation created by a UMBC CoLab team that documents the effects of climate change in the Arctic. It was made for NOAA's Science on a Sphere presentation system for the purpose of being shown in museums and visitors' centers to educate the general public. This project was created by using a combination of original expedidition videos from the Arctic region, open source video and image content, original maps created using Arctic expedition data, and NOAA Science on a Sphere maps.
